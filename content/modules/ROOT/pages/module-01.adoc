== Introduction to Event-Driven Ansible

Event-Driven Ansible allows you to codify your response to infrastructure and application events, making your automation more resilient and responsive. While Automation Controller (via playbooks) automates a response, Event-Driven Ansible (via rulebooks) automates the recognition of the event itself.

In recent releases of Ansible Automation Platform (AAP), components are co-located in a unified UI. The integration of Event-Driven Ansible and Automation Controller is configured by creating a credential that **Automation Decisions** can use to execute templates in **Automation Execution**.

.   **Log in to Ansible Automation Platform.** **Click** the `AAP` tab and log in using the `admin` / `ansible123!` credentials.

.   **Explore the UI.** After you log in, notice the menu sections for **Automation Execution** (Automation Controller) and **Automation Decisions** (Event-Driven Ansible Controller). As you work through this lab, you may need to navigate between these component menus.
* **Automation Decisions:** This is where event conditions are defined in *Rulebooks* and activated via *Rulebook Activations*.
* **Automation Execution:** This is where the *actions* are defined as *Templates* that run playbooks.

.   **Create a credential for Automation Decisions.** You must first create a credential to allow the two components to communicate. **Navigate** to **Automation Decisions** → **Infrastructure** → **Credentials** and **click** the **Create credential** button.

.   **Enter the credential details.** **Fill** out the form with the following details:
